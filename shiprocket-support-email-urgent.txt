Subject: Urgent: API IP Whitelist Needed - Company ID 5783639

Dear Shiprocket Support Team,

I am unable to access Shiprocket API endpoints from my application. All API calls return:
"Unauthorized! You do not have the required permissions[IP]."

ACCOUNT DETAILS:
- Email: contact@yoraa.in
- Company ID: 5783639
- Company Name: YORAA APPARELS PRIVATE LIMITED
- Phone: 7006114695

IP ADDRESS TO WHITELIST:
- 122.161.240.166

PROBLEM:
Every API endpoint call (authentication works fine) returns 403 error with message: "Unauthorized! You do not have the required permissions[IP]."

Specifically failing on:
- /orders/create/adhoc (order creation)
- /courier/courierListWithCounts
- /orders (order list)

WHAT I'VE TRIED:
1. Verified credentials are correct (authentication succeeds)
2. Added IP in "API Users" section - but this didn't resolve the issue
3. Unable to locate the main "API Integration IP Whitelist" section in dashboard

REQUEST:
Please whitelist IP address 122.161.240.166 for full API access, especially:
- Order creation API
- Courier API  
- Order management API

OR

Please guide me to the exact location in dashboard where I can add IP whitelist for API integration (not the "API Users" section).

URGENCY:
This is blocking our production e-commerce system. Orders are being placed by customers but cannot be automatically sent to Shiprocket for shipping.

Please assist as soon as possible.

Best regards,
Rithik Mahajan
