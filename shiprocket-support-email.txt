Subject: Enable API Access & IP Whitelisting - Company ID 5783639

Dear Shiprocket Support Team,

I am experiencing 403 "Unauthorized! You do not have the required permissions[IP]" 
errors when attempting to create orders via the Shiprocket API.

Account Details:
- Email: contact@yoraa.in
- Company ID: 5783639
- Company Name: YORAA APPARELS PRIVATE LIMITED
- User ID: 5996773

Current Issue:
- Endpoint: POST /v1/external/orders/create/adhoc
- Error: "Unauthorized! You do not have the required permissions[IP]"
- Authentication: Working (token generation successful)
- Order Creation: Failing with 403 error

Request:
1. Enable full API access for order creation and management
2. Whitelist the following IP address for API access:
   - Development/Production IP: 122.161.240.166
3. Remove any IP-based restrictions on my account
4. Confirm if there are any additional account verification steps needed

Technical Details:
- Using main account credentials for API authentication
- Following Shiprocket API documentation
- Backend properly implemented with token management
- Issue is specifically related to IP restrictions

Please enable unrestricted API access or whitelist the IP address mentioned above.

Best regards,
Rithik Mahajan
