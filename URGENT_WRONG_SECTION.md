# ⚠️ CRITICAL: YOU'RE IN THE WRONG SECTION!

## 🔴 WHAT I SEE IN YOUR SCREENSHOT

You're in: **Settings → Additional Settings → API Users**

This section is for creating **dashboard users**, NOT for IP whitelisting!

---

## ✅ CORRECT LOCATION FOR IP WHITELIST

### Go to the RIGHT "API" Section:

1. **In Shiprocket Dashboard Left Sidebar**, look for:
   - **"Settings"** (gear icon)
   
2. Then look for **TWO different "API" options**:
   
   ❌ **"Additional Settings → API Users"** (where you are now - WRONG)
   
   ✅ **"Shiprocket Features → API"** (where IP whitelist is - CORRECT)
   
   OR
   
   ✅ **"Settings → API Integration"** 
   
   OR
   
   ✅ **"Settings → Developers → API"**

## 🎯 DIRECT URLS TO TRY

Try accessing these URLs directly:

1. https://app.shiprocket.in/seller/settings/api-integration
2. https://app.shiprocket.in/seller/api-settings
3. https://app.shiprocket.in/seller/settings/developer
4. https://app.shiprocket.in/seller/settings/api-access

---

## 🔍 WHAT TO LOOK FOR

Once in the correct section, you should see:

✅ **"IP Whitelisting"** heading
✅ **"Add IP Address"** input field  
✅ **"Generate API Token"** button (maybe)
✅ **"Webhook URL"** settings (maybe)

You should **NOT** see:
❌ "API Users" list
❌ "Buyer Detail Access"
❌ "Update User" buttons
