Subject: URGENT: Enable API Integration IP Whitelist - Company ID 5783639

Dear Shiprocket Support Team,

I am facing API access issues and need immediate assistance.

ISSUE:
All API endpoints return: "Unauthorized! You do not have the required permissions[IP]."

ACCOUNT DETAILS:
- Main Account Email: contact@yoraa.in
- Company ID: 5783639
- Company Name: YORAA APPARELS PRIVATE LIMITED

WHAT I'VE TRIED:
1. Added IP to "API Users" section (for dashboard user support@yoraa.in)
2. IPs added: 127.0.0.1, 0.0.0.0, 122.161.240.166, 165.193.19.244
3. Still getting 403 "Unauthorized [IP]" errors on ALL API endpoints

WHAT I NEED:
I cannot find the "API Integration" or "API Settings" IP whitelist section in my dashboard.
I only see "Additional Settings → API Users" which is for dashboard access, not API calls.

REQUEST:
Please either:
1. Enable and configure API Integration IP whitelist for my account
2. Guide me to the correct section in dashboard
3. Whitelist these IPs directly for API access:
   - Production IP: 165.193.19.244
   - Development IP: 122.161.240.166

URGENCY:
This is blocking our production order fulfillment system. Every customer order is failing to create shipment.

TEST ENDPOINTS FAILING:
- POST /v1/external/orders/create/adhoc
- GET /v1/external/orders
- GET /v1/external/courier/courierListWithCounts
- All other endpoints

AUTHENTICATION STATUS:
✅ Authentication works (token received successfully)
✅ Using main account credentials (contact@yoraa.in)
❌ All subsequent API calls blocked with [IP] error

Please assist urgently or call me to resolve this.
