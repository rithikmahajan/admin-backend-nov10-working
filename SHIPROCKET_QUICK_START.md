## 🎯 Why This Happened

**Shiprocket API User Confusion**:
- Dashboard shows "API User" feature
- It's **NOT** for API authentication!
- It's only for creating additional dashboard users
- **API authentication = Your main login**

**IP Restriction**:
- Shiprocket blocks API calls from non-whitelisted IPs
- Security feature to prevent unauthorized access
- Simple fix: Add your IP to whitelist
